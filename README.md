## FEATURE

#### Unlock private Instagram posts? Almost.  
Even if you have **```0% idea about them```**, see what they don’t want you to i.e. every **```collaborated post and who they collaborated with```** from a private account, revealed by colllaborating with a public profile **(all without logging in!)**
